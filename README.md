# OOP Exercise 3

There is a test suite to guide you and help you check yourself. To run the test suite, just view `SpecRunner.html` in your browser. I suggest using live server so that your tests rerun when you save you file.

**Important:** The test cases specify the name of the required methods, arguments, etc. So **read each test case carefully.** Test cases are located in the spec folder.

All functions should be defined in main.js located in the src folder. **This is the only file you should edit.**

Your task is to write a JavaScript program that creates a class `Book` with properties for title, author, and publication year. Include a method to display book details.

 **You should pass all test cases.**
